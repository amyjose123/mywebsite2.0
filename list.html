            <ol style="font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif;color:#333333;">
                <li><b><i>Flower of Evil</i></b>
                    <p align="justify">Flower of Evil is one of the best thriller, drama, and romance K-dramas I’ve ever watched. The plot is masterfully crafted, weaving intense suspense with deeply emotional moments that keep you hooked from start to finish. Lee Joon-gi's exceptional performance, especially in Episode 15, moved me to tears and showcased his incredible range as an actor. Moon Chae-won’s portrayal added layers of vulnerability and strength, perfectly complementing the story’s intensity. The entire cast delivered stellar performances, making every character feel authentic and impactful. With its gripping storyline, heart-stopping twists, and profound exploration of love and trust, Flower of Evil is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates well-balanced thrillers and heartfelt dramas.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b><i>Mr Plankton</i></b>
                    <p align="justify">Mr. Plankton is a beautifully crafted drama that left a lasting impression on me. The main leads delivered phenomenal performances, with their emotional acting and undeniable chemistry bringing the characters to life. The story, though labeled a rom-com, carries a bittersweet tone, as it follows two people with unfortunate circumstances who find solace in each other while embarking on a poignant journey. I was especially moved by Eu Heung's character—what an incredible performance! The use of California Dreamin' at the end of each episode perfectly complements the melancholic yet hopeful mood of the drama. Despite its sad ending, Mr. Plankton is a deeply touching experience that lingers in your heart.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b><i>Begins≠Youth</i></b>
                    <p align="justify">Begins≠Youth is a fantastic series that blends the BTS universe with an emotional storyline, much like the webtoon Save Me. As a BTS fan, I really enjoyed the performances, which were heartfelt and authentic. The opening and ending were perfectly done, leaving me eagerly awaiting Season 2. The show captures the essence of BTS’ messages—hope, resilience, and self-discovery. Everything, from the acting to the plot, was top-notch, making it a truly enjoyable experience. Can’t wait for the next season!</p>
